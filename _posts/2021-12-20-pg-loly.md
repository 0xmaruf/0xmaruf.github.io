Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) Medium machines which called `Loly` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:

- Using `wpscan` against wordpress running on port `80`:
```bash
wpscan --rua --url http://loly.lc/wordpress/ -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

- We found a valid Credentials for `wordpress`:

### Getting Shell:
1. First lets make a shell and zip it:

2. Uploading the shell:

3. Access the shell:

4. We got RCE:

## Privilege Escalation:
- Creds on `wp-config.php` file:

```
/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'lolyisabeautifulgirl' );
```

- Switching to `loly` user using the password that we found on `wp-config.php` file:
