Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) Medium machines which called `Funbox` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:
![nmap](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/nmap.png)

- Enumerating users on `Wordpress` running on port 80 using `wpscan`:
```bash
wpscan --url http://funbox.fritz.box/ -e u1-20
```

- Valid wordpress users:
![users](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/wp-users.png)

- Dictionary attack on ssh using `hydra`:
![hydra](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/hydra.png)


## Privilege Escalation:

- Checking `funny` user home directory:
![funny-home](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/funny-home.png)

    * As shown in the picture above the script `.backup.sh` is writable by anyone on the box and it keeps running doing backup to `/var/www/html`

- Exploit `.backup.sh` script:
    * Generating bash reverse shell [payload](https://bing0o.github.io/posts/reverse-shell-generator/):
    ![netcat](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/netcat.png)

    * Injecting the payload to `.backup.sh` script:
    ![inject](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/inject.png)

- Wainting for a few minutes and boom!:
![root](../../assets/img/sample/pg-funbox/root.png)


Happy Hacking!
