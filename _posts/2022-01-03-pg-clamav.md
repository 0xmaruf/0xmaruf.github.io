Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) Easy machines which called `ClamAV` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:

- Using Searchsploit to search for `clamav`:
