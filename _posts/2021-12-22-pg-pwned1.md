Hello,

We are going to exploit one of [OffSec Proving Grounds](https://portal.offensive-security.com/proving-grounds/play) Medium machines which called `Pwned1` and this post is not a fully detailed walkthrough, I will just go through the important points during the exploit process.

## Enumeration:
- Nmap:

- Reading `/robots.txt`:

- We got a list of possible paths on the server on `/hidden_text/secret.dic`
![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-pwned1/paths.png)

- Running `gobuster` using that list:

- Checking the source code of that page:
	* we have a user and password: `ftpuser:B0ss_Pr!ncesS`:

- Login to ftp:

- Downloading `id_rsa` and `notes.txt` files to our local machine:

- Getting Shell through `SSH`:

## Privilege Escalation:
- Enumeration:
	* sudo -l: we can run `/home/messenger.sh` script as selena without password.

	* Reading `/home/messenger.sh` file:
    
    ![image](../../assets/img/sample/pg-pwned1/messenger.png)

- Getting shell as `selena` user:

```bash
sudo -u selena /home/messenger.sh
```

- As you can see in the screenshot above, we are a part of `docker` group, so let's [exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRBj2dm4CDU) that:

```bash
docker run -v /:/mnt -it alpine
```

Happy Hacking!
